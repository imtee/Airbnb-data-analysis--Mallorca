## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Airbnb data provided at http://insideairbnb.com/ to get an idea about the landscape of Airbnb housing in Mallorca, Spain. The following questions are used as a guidleline:

1. What are the top regions with the highest listings in Airbnb?
2. Which types of accommodations are mostly offered?
3. What are the prices of accommodations listed?
4. What are the reviews and ratings of previous travelers?

The datasets that we used describe the listing activity of homestays in the island between April 2020 to April 2021, and it is basically a snapshot of home-stays available at a particular time, in this case between 23rd and 25th of April of 2020. The datasets are available [here](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html)


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. 


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@ayedins/visiting-majorca-after-lockdown-c75a01ed6061).
